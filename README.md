# Vietnam War through Statistics

In this project, I explore statistics from the Vietnam War with the THOR dataset. 

### Data Source and Requirements

Please find requirements in the ```requirements.txt``` file. 
Data set is found on Kaggle [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usaf/vietnam-war-bombing-operations?select=THOR_Vietnam_Weapons_Glossary.csv). 

### Vietnam Bombing Notebook 

This notebook examines mainly country-specific involvement in bombing-related activities in the war, such as time spent on mission, flight hours, bomb dropped,.... A chronological approach was taken to this as the collective examination shows, by logic, that the US was the entity most involved by count. 

Several interesting historical observations are made examining this visualisation! please see notebook for further thoughts around the activities relating to Rolling Thunder (1968) and Vietnamisation (1969) onwards.

*Observation: We see a sharp rise in US weapon delivered in 1971. What does delivered mean? What happened in 1971?*
